N4Mplan

A server-less data management plan (DMP) generation tool in your browser based on [nfdi4plants/dataplan](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/dataplan).

We merely customized the appearance and some of the content to our needs.
Credits go to the original authors authors: [Zhou Xiaoran](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5622-3348) and [Bj√∂rn Usadel](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0921-8041).


## How can I use it?
"Data management plan generator" can create a data management plan automatically. 
This is a very simple way to make a DMP. By using this Generator, you can create
1. a full Data Management Plan for Horizon Europe and H2020 projects;
2. a full Data Management Plan for DFG projects;
3. a summary for funding proposal;
4. a customized practical guide throughout your projects
5. a user defined template that you can edit freely (this is the single most crazily f--king overpowered feature that noone will ever make use of, pure flex!)

The "Data management plan generator" is serverless. All functions works even if you disconnect the internet after loading the website.
You could even use "control + S" to save the website and use it for a later time. Just remember that the local cache will be different between the different URLs.

Everything is kept in your browser's local storage:

- The answer of the question
- The status of usage (first time visitor or not)
- the user defined template

As a bonus: Programming bugs also persist in your cache! Why would anyone check valid input?


## What is it made of?
- `js/`: javascripts (JS dependencies, because mixing all of the hip frameworks is phun)  
- `css/`: css files (that are hardly used, we believe in writing out identical properties in every single tag repeatedly by using as many lines possible, of course in the index.html)  
- `docs/`: document templates (decoys currently not used, just to confuse you, all documents are included in the index.html)
- `saved_json/`: json files including saved answers (got you again, everything is in the horrible index.html!)
- `index.html` : metric ton of monolithic spagetti code ~enjoy!~ We were paid by lines of code and empty lines paid double!
